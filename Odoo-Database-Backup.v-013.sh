# This script will generate (and remove) some temp files in the current dir.

# This script is intended to perform an external backup of main and duplicated DataBases hosted on Odoo-Online. It can be called by cron-weekly or any similar thing you like. Odoo platform would probably be unhappy to see this script run more than once a day.

# Developped for Odoo v16.
# Tested with Odoo v16.0
